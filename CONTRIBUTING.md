# Contributing

I'm happy if you'd like to contribute to this project.

In most cases, please create an issue explaining your problems or ideas and usecases. Please check for duplicate issues first.

This project follows the "bias for action", so if you like to contribute code-wise, feel free to create a pull request with your changes.
If there's already an issue about the thing you want to fix or add, please add a short note that you're working on that to avoid double work.

An ideal pull request ...

- adds the changes in the code,
- adds new test cases or updates existing ones if necessary,
- does not pull in new external dependencies unless explicitly necessary,
- has a meaningful description,
- follows [conventional commits][conv-commits] and
- consists only of content that you're legally allowed to contribute under the project's license.

When encountering any problems, feel free to ask about them by writing a comment on your own pull request.
