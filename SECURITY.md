# Security information

Although real security problems for this are less probable since the exposure of the tool is quite limited, security bugs could exist.

If you find something concerning in this regard, please report it confidentially via [GitHub's security problem reporting](https://github.com/ErikMichelson/apt-deb822-tool/security/advisories/new).

I will do a first check of your report within 7 days and comment the further procedure.
